TmCGPT Editor ver1.2

------------------------



// What's this?

This is a text editor specialized in creating text for ChatGPT. It should be compatible with Windows 7 or later, but it has been checked on Windows 10.

Features:

Main editor and preview screen divided into five vertical parts
Syntax highlighting for various programming languages
20 preset phrase buttons (saved to a text file)
Automatic logging and saving to database upon copying to clipboard, with full-text search using an in-memory SQL database (which makes full-text search of logs reasonably fast, I think).


// How to

No installation is required. Just launch TmCGPTD.exe. It is a simple software, so there should be no confusing parts, but I will explain the keyboard shortcuts.
Ctrl + numeric keys 1-9 and 0 correspond to preset phrases 1-10, and Alt + numeric keys 1-9 and 0 correspond to preset phrases 11-20.
Ctrl + Return key copies to clipboard and saves to log.
Also, you can zoom in and out on the font by scrolling the mouse wheel while holding down Ctrl.
